# Database_A4

Hi! So, when I was doing this, I figured I'd go through all the commands and then just do a Ctrl+A in order to get all of the commands. I didn't realize until I had
closed the window and went to submit that that wasn't going to work how I intended or wanted, so please take my word for it that I did the commands before the massive 
one listing the creation criteria for a new database.
